- Tailwind CSS configured with custom theme
- Basic component structure created
- Campaign management with full CRUD
- Pathways with member tracking
- Event registration system
- Contact management with tags and custom fields
- Multi-organization support

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented
- **Contact Queue**: UI is built and connected to Supabase
- **Contact Card**: Functional UI now saves to Supabase
- **Dashboard**: Layout exists with real data from Supabase
- **Offline Sync**: Store structure exists but not connected to IndexedDB
- **PWA**: Manifest exists but service worker not properly implemented

### ‚úÖ Recently Fixed
- **Campaign Management**: Fully implemented from mockup to functional feature
- **Pathways System**: Complete implementation with member tracking
- **Event Registration**: New public registration system with capacity management
- **Authentication**: Now using real Supabase auth with full implementation
- **Supabase Integration**: All data operations now use real Supabase, mockData.ts removed
- **Contact Service**: Fully implemented with Supabase integration
- **Admin Dashboard**: Shows real statistics from Supabase
- **Contact Sorting**: Added sorting by name, date created, last contact, and events attended
- **Password Reset**: Implemented complete password reset flow with email
- **Logout Enhancement**: Proper logout that clears all local data including IndexedDB
- **Test Suite**: Fixed all test failures - 105 tests now passing
- **Auth Loading State**: Fixed endless loading issue by properly handling auth state and profile loading errors
- **Demo Login**: Fixed demo account setup and login functionality
  - Updated `setup-demo-user.js` script to use proper UUIDs
  - Fixed organization ID to match the UUID in database migrations
  - Handled existing user updates properly

- **RLS Infinite Recursion**: Fixed Row Level Security policies causing infinite recursion
  - Issue: `get_user_organization_id()` function was querying the users table with RLS enabled
  - Users table RLS policies were calling the same function, creating a loop
  - Solution: Rewrote user policies to avoid recursive function calls
  - Created SQL script to fix the issue: `fix-rls-recursion.sql`

## Deployment Learnings

### Cloudflare Pages Deployment
- Successfully deployed to Cloudflare Pages using `wrangler pages deploy`
- Production URL: https://contact-manager-pwa.pages.dev
- Build output directory: `dist/`
- Environment variables need to be set in Cloudflare dashboard separately from wrangler.toml

### TypeScript Build Fixes
- Fixed error handling in catch blocks by properly typing errors:
  - Changed `err.message` to `err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'fallback'`
  - This prevents TypeScript TS18046 errors for unknown types in catch blocks

### Character Encoding Issues
- Terminal output may show Unicode/encoding issues when using wrangler CLI
- The deployment still works correctly despite display issues

## Contact Queue Implementation (2025-05-28)
- The contact queue was showing "no contacts" because it was looking for a `call_assignments` table that doesn't exist
- Solution: Load contacts directly from the contacts table, prioritizing those never called
- The contacts table uses `last_contacted` field, not `last_called_at`
- The contacts table uses a single `full_name` field instead of `first_name`/`last_name` (see migration 003)
- When no contacts are available, provide helpful navigation to pathways, events, and campaigns
- Contacts become available for calling based on:
  - Never been contacted (highest priority)
  - Not contacted in 30+ days (secondary priority)
- Empty state now provides actionable next steps for volunteers

## Email Service Integration (2025-05-28)
- Replaced mocked Mailgun implementation with Twilio SendGrid
- SendGrid integrates seamlessly with existing Twilio account (single billing)
- Key implementation details:
  - SendGrid API uses different format than Mailgun (personalizations array)
  - Batch sending supports up to 1000 recipients per API call
  - Dynamic templates can be stored in SendGrid or our database
  - Webhook events come as arrays, not single objects
- Environment variables needed:
  - `VITE_SENDGRID_API_KEY`: API key from SendGrid dashboard
  - `VITE_SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`: Verified sender email
  - Template IDs for each email type (optional)
- Free tier provides 100 emails/day which is good for testing
- Production would need Essentials ($19.95/mo) or Pro (usage-based) plan

## Organization API Keys Implementation (2025-05-28)
- Designed and implemented per-organization API key management system
- Key features:
  - Organizations can use their own API keys for third-party services
  - Automatic fallback to system keys for unpaid organizations
  - Rate limiting based on subscription plan (free/basic/pro/enterprise)
  - Usage tracking and cost estimation
  - Encrypted key storage (placeholder for Supabase Vault)
- Database schema:
  - `organization_api_keys`: Encrypted storage for service credentials
  - `organization_subscriptions`: Billing and plan management
  - `organization_api_usage`: Monthly partitioned usage tracking
  - `rate_limit_rules`: Configurable limits by plan and service
  - `organization_api_key_audit`: Audit trail for security
- Service layer implementation:
  - `OrganizationAPIKeyService`: Singleton for key management
  - Key CRUD operations with audit logging
  - Rate limit checking before API calls
  - Usage tracking after successful calls
  - Service configuration with custom key fallback
- Modified services:
  - `EmailService`: Now checks org keys before system keys
  - `SMSService`: Supports org-specific Twilio credentials
  - Both services track usage for billing/rate limiting
- Admin UI:
  - `APIKeysManagement` component at `/admin/api-keys`
  - Secure input fields with masking
  - Test connection functionality
  - Shows subscription status and rate limits
- Implementation notes:
  - Keys should be encrypted using Supabase Vault in production
  - Cloudflare Worker needs updates to accept org-specific keys
  - Rate limiting uses database functions for accuracy
  - Usage partitioned by month for performance
- Next steps for completion:
  - Implement Stripe billing integration
