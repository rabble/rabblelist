# Contact Manager PWA - Learnings

## Project Overview
- Mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) for contact management
- Built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase
- Target deployment: Cloudflare Workers
- Purpose: Enable "Ringers" to call supporters through organized contact queues

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Offline Storage**: IndexedDB (via idb library)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **PWA**: vite-plugin-pwa with Workbox
- **CSV Parsing**: Papaparse

## Key Features Identified
1. **Authentication**: Multi-tenant with organization support
2. **Contact Management**: CRUD operations, tags, custom fields
3. **Calling Queue**: Priority-based contact queuing system
4. **Event Management**: Create events, check-ins, RSVPs
5. **Offline Support**: IndexedDB sync with Supabase
6. **CSV Import/Export**: Bulk contact management
7. **Admin Dashboard**: Organization and user management
8. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly UI, click-to-call
9. **PWA Features**: Installable, offline-capable, push notifications

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What's Working
- Basic project structure is set up
- All dependencies are installed
- PWA manifest and icons configured
- Basic routing structure in place
- TypeScript configuration
- Tailwind CSS configured with custom theme
- Basic component structure created

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented
- **Authentication**: Using mockAuth instead of real Supabase auth
- **Contact Queue**: UI is built but uses mock data
- **Contact Card**: Functional UI but saves to localStorage instead of Supabase
- **Dashboard**: Layout exists but shows placeholder content
- **Offline Sync**: Store structure exists but not connected to IndexedDB
- **PWA**: Manifest exists but service worker not properly implemented

### ❌ Not Implemented / Using Mocks
- **Supabase Integration**: All data operations use mockData.ts
- **Contact Management**: List view exists but no CRUD operations
- **Events System**: Components exist but no functionality
- **Groups/Units**: Only mock data displayed
- **Pathways**: Component stub only
- **Admin Dashboard**: Shows mock statistics
- **CSV Import/Export**: Not implemented
- **Search/Filter**: UI exists but not functional
- **User Registration**: No signup flow
- **Password Reset**: Not implemented
- **Service Worker**: Referenced but file doesn't exist
- **Push Notifications**: Not implemented
- **Background Sync**: Not implemented
- **Conflict Resolution**: Not implemented
- **Real-time Updates**: Not implemented

### 🐛 Known Issues
1. Service worker registration fails (file doesn't exist)
2. All data operations use localStorage instead of Supabase
3. No error handling for failed operations
4. No loading states for async operations
5. Authentication is completely mocked
6. No data validation on forms
7. No pagination on list views
8. No proper TypeScript types for API responses

## Database Schema (from migrations)
- Organizations table with multi-tenant support
- Contacts with custom fields and tags
- Events with check-ins
- Groups/Units hierarchy
- Pathways for engagement tracking
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies

## Environment Configuration
- Uses .env.local for Supabase credentials
- Demo mode toggle script available
- Database setup script provided

## Build & Deployment
- Vite for development and building
- Configured for Cloudflare Workers deployment
- PWA build includes service worker

## Notable Files
- `setup-database.sh`: Automated database setup
- `toggle-demo-mode.sh`: Switch between demo/real data
- `wrangler.toml`: Cloudflare Workers configuration
- Multiple README files with setup instructions

## UI/UX Considerations
- Mobile-first design approach
- Touch-optimized interfaces
- Offline feedback mechanisms
- Loading states and error handling
- Accessibility features needed

## Security Considerations
- Row Level Security in Supabase
- Organization-based data isolation
- Authentication required for all operations
- API key management

## Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting for features
- Lazy loading routes
- IndexedDB for offline caching
- PWA caching strategies

## Integration Points
- Supabase for backend
- Potential SMS/calling service integration
- CSV import/export functionality
- Push notification service
