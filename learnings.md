# Contact Manager PWA - Learnings

## Project Overview
- Mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) for contact management
- Built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Offline Storage**: IndexedDB (via idb library)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **PWA**: vite-plugin-pwa with Workbox
- **CSV Parsing**: Papaparse

## Key Features Identified
1. **Authentication**: Multi-tenant with organization support
2. **Contact Management**: CRUD operations, tags, custom fields
3. **Calling Queue**: Priority-based contact queuing system
4. **Event Management**: Create events, check-ins, RSVPs
5. **Offline Support**: IndexedDB sync with Supabase
6. **CSV Import/Export**: Bulk contact management
7. **Admin Dashboard**: Organization and user management
8. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly UI, click-to-call
9. **PWA Features**: Installable, offline-capable, push notifications

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What's Working
- Basic project structure is set up
- All dependencies are installed
- PWA manifest and icons configured
- Basic routing structure in place
- TypeScript configuration
- Tailwind CSS configured with custom theme
- Basic component structure created

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented
- **Contact Queue**: UI is built and connected to Supabase
- **Contact Card**: Functional UI now saves to Supabase
- **Dashboard**: Layout exists with real data from Supabase
- **Offline Sync**: Store structure exists but not connected to IndexedDB
- **PWA**: Manifest exists but service worker not properly implemented

### ✅ Recently Fixed
- **Authentication**: Now using real Supabase auth with full implementation
- **Supabase Integration**: All data operations now use real Supabase, mockData.ts removed
- **Contact Service**: Fully implemented with Supabase integration
- **Admin Dashboard**: Shows real statistics from Supabase
- **Contact Sorting**: Added sorting by name, date created, last contact, and events attended
- **Password Reset**: Implemented complete password reset flow with email
- **Logout Enhancement**: Proper logout that clears all local data including IndexedDB
- **Test Suite**: Fixed all test failures - 105 tests now passing
- **Auth Loading State**: Fixed endless loading issue by properly handling auth state and profile loading errors

### ❌ Not Implemented / Using Mocks
- **Contact Management**: List view exists but no CRUD operations
- **Events System**: Components exist but no functionality
- **Groups/Units**: Only mock data displayed
- **Pathways**: Component stub only
- **Admin Dashboard**: Shows mock statistics
- **CSV Import/Export**: Not implemented
- **Search/Filter**: UI exists but not functional
- **User Registration**: No signup flow
- **Password Reset**: Not implemented
- **Service Worker**: Referenced but file doesn't exist
- **Push Notifications**: Not implemented
- **Background Sync**: Not implemented
- **Conflict Resolution**: Not implemented
- **Real-time Updates**: Not implemented

### 🐛 Known Issues
1. Service worker registration fails (file doesn't exist)
2. All data operations use localStorage instead of Supabase
3. No error handling for failed operations
4. No loading states for async operations
5. Authentication is completely mocked
6. No data validation on forms
7. No pagination on list views
8. No proper TypeScript types for API responses

## Database Schema (from migrations)
- Organizations table with multi-tenant support
- Contacts with custom fields and tags
- Events with check-ins
- Groups/Units hierarchy
- Pathways for engagement tracking
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies

## Environment Configuration
- Uses .env.local for Supabase credentials
- Demo mode toggle script available
- Database setup script provided

## Build & Deployment
- Vite for development and building
- Configured for Cloudflare Workers deployment
- PWA build includes service worker

## Notable Files
- `setup-database.sh`: Automated database setup
- `toggle-demo-mode.sh`: Switch between demo/real data
- `wrangler.toml`: Cloudflare Workers configuration
- Multiple README files with setup instructions

## Recent Implementations

### Retry Logic
- Created `retryUtils.ts` with exponential backoff and jitter
- Intelligent retry that skips auth/permission/validation errors
- Applied to ContactService and can be used across all services

### Organization Switching
- Created `OrganizationSwitcher` component for multi-org users
- Added migration for `user_organizations` junction table
- Simulated multi-org access for admin users

### Custom Fields
- `CustomFieldsConfig` component for admin management
- Supports text, number, date, select, and checkbox types
- Fields stored in organization settings JSON
- Integrated into ContactForm with dynamic rendering

### Contact Deduplication
- `ContactDeduplication` component finds duplicates by phone/email/name
- Merges all data into primary (oldest) contact
- Updates all references in related tables
- Batch merge capability for multiple groups

### Testing Infrastructure
- Added comprehensive test suites for AuthContext and ProtectedRoute
- Created debug tests to identify loading state issues
- Fixed error handling in AuthContext for:
  - Missing Supabase configuration
  - Network errors
  - Profile loading failures
  - Synchronous errors in getSession
- Added try-catch blocks to handle both sync and async errors
- Ensured loading state always resolves to false even on errors

## UI/UX Considerations
- Mobile-first design approach
- Touch-optimized interfaces
- Offline feedback mechanisms
- Loading states and error handling
- Accessibility features needed

## Security Considerations
- Row Level Security in Supabase
- Organization-based data isolation
- Authentication required for all operations
- API key management

## Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting for features
- Lazy loading routes
- IndexedDB for offline caching
- PWA caching strategies

## Integration Points
- Supabase for backend
- Potential SMS/calling service integration
- CSV import/export functionality
- Push notification service

## Deployment Learnings

### Cloudflare Pages Deployment
- Successfully deployed to Cloudflare Pages using `wrangler pages deploy`
- Production URL: https://contact-manager-pwa.pages.dev
- Build output directory: `dist/`
- Environment variables need to be set in Cloudflare dashboard separately from wrangler.toml

### TypeScript Build Fixes
- Fixed error handling in catch blocks by properly typing errors:
  - Changed `err.message` to `err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'fallback'`
  - This prevents TypeScript TS18046 errors for unknown types in catch blocks

### Character Encoding Issues
- Terminal output may show Unicode/encoding issues when using wrangler CLI
- The deployment still works correctly despite display issues
