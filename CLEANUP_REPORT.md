# Cleanup Report - Issues to Fix

## Overview
This report identifies mocked features, incomplete implementations, and cleanup tasks needed in the Contact Manager PWA.

## 1. Console.log Statements (40 found)
- **Issue**: Production code contains 40 console.log statements that should be removed
- **Action**: Remove all console.log statements from non-test files
- **Priority**: Medium

## 2. Phone Banking Implementation
- **Current State**: 
  - PhoneBankService attempts to make real calls via Twilio
  - Requires VITE_TELEPHONY_WEBHOOK_URL environment variable
  - Worker exists at `/workers/telephony/` but needs deployment
- **Issues**:
  - No actual Twilio credentials configured
  - Webhook URL not deployed
  - Click-to-call functionality not fully integrated
- **Action**: Either complete Twilio integration or clearly mark as demo-only

## 3. Email Service
- **Current State**:
  - Uses SendGrid API (Twilio's email service)
  - Has proper error handling and retry logic
  - Supports templates and tracking
- **Issues**:
  - Requires organization API keys to be configured
  - Email tracking dashboard shows estimated stats, not real data
- **Action**: Document API key setup process clearly

## 4. SMS Service
- **Current State**:
  - Two-way SMS conversations implemented
  - Uses Twilio API
  - Webhook handler for inbound messages
- **Issues**:
  - Requires Twilio credentials
  - Webhook URL needs to be deployed
- **Action**: Complete Twilio setup documentation

## 5. Offline Sync
- **Current State**:
  - Full offline sync implemented with conflict resolution
  - IndexedDB storage configured
  - Service worker registered
- **Issues**: None - fully implemented

## 6. Event Features
- **Current State**:
  - QR code check-in fully implemented
  - Attendance dashboard with real-time updates
  - Walk-in registration supported
  - Email confirmations and reminders
- **Issues**: None - fully implemented

## 7. Contact Features
- **Current State**:
  - Smart lists implemented
  - Contact scoring implemented
  - Bulk operations implemented
  - Timeline view implemented
- **Issues**: None - fully implemented

## 8. Missing Environment Variables
The following environment variables need to be set for full functionality:
- `VITE_SENDGRID_API_KEY` - For email sending
- `VITE_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - For SMS/calling
- `VITE_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - For SMS/calling
- `VITE_TELEPHONY_WEBHOOK_URL` - For phone banking
- `VITE_SMS_WEBHOOK_URL` - For inbound SMS

## 9. TypeScript Errors
Multiple TypeScript errors exist in the codebase:
- Unused imports (should use ESLint to auto-fix)
- Type mismatches in some components
- Missing type definitions

## 10. Features Marked as "Coming Soon"
None found - all UI features appear to be implemented.

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Remove all console.log statements
2. Fix TypeScript errors
3. Add clear documentation about which features require external API keys

### Medium Priority
1. Complete Twilio integration or add demo mode indicators
2. Deploy webhook workers for SMS/calling
3. Add API key configuration UI in admin panel

### Low Priority
1. Add loading states for all async operations
2. Improve error messages for missing configurations
3. Add telemetry/analytics integration

## Summary
The application is largely complete with the following main issues:
- External service integrations (Twilio, SendGrid) need API keys
- Console.log statements need removal
- TypeScript errors need fixing
- Documentation needs to clarify setup requirements

All core features (contacts, events, campaigns, offline sync) are fully implemented and functional.
